# üõ∞Ô∏è Frontend Communication Protocol

This document defines the request and reply structures for communication between the **frontend** and **backend**.

**User1 sends a message to User2**

  "message": "any message",
  "relatedId": "UUID of user2"
} 
```

### Reply (to User1)
```json
{
  "type": "messageResponse",
  "message": "any message",
  "relatedId": "UUID of user1"
}
```
### Reply (to User2)

### Request (from User1)
```json
{
  "type": "block",

}
```

### Reply (to User1)
```json
{
  "type": "blockResponse",
  "relatedId": "UUID of user2",
  "notification": "optional for debugging",
}
```
Note: No reply is sent to User2 by default. Can be add upon request.


## üö´ 3. Block Status Check

** User1 checks User2 block status **

### Request (from User1)

  "relatedId": "UUID of user2"
}
```

### Reply (to User2)
``` json
{
  "type": "inviteResponse",
  "relatedId": "UUID of user1",
  "roomId": "Room id to open socket",
  "notification": "optional for debugging",
}

## ‚ùå 5. Terminate user

**If you want to close websocket connection of client**

{
  "inviteAccepted": true,
  "relatedId": "UUID of user1"
}
```

### Reply (to User1)

{
  "openSocket": true,
  "relatedId": "UUID of user2"
}
``` -->

<!-- No need this step as process is simpler now -->
<!-- ### üîå Socket Initialization

**Once the socket is established, User1 must notify the backend**

### Request (from User1)
```json
{
  "socketOpened": true,
  "relatedId": "UUID of user2"
}
```

### Reply (to User2)
``` json
{
  "joinRoom": true,
  "roomId": "room id to build connection with"
}
``` -->

## üë§ New Client Joined

**A new client (e.g., user101) joins the app**

### Reply (to user101)

  "relatedId": "UUID of user101",
  "notification": "optional for debugging",
}
```

## üîå Disconnection Event

**When a client disconnects, the backend sends a disconnection event.**

### Reply (to other clients)
```json
{
  "type": "disconnected",
  "relatedId": "UUID of the disconnected client",
  "notification": "optional for debugging",
}
```
Note: This event informs all other clients about the disconnection, and they can update their UI accordingly (e.g., removing the user from the online list).


## ‚ùå Error Handling

**In case of an error, the backend replies with an error message**

### Reply (to client)
```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "relatedId": "UUID of the client",
  "error": "Description of the error"
}
```
