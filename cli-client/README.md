# CLI Client 🐍

## Setting up

### Automatically

Use **"make"** (`make cli`) to create virtual env and start CLI Client (main menu)

### Manually

1. cd into `cli-client` folder
2. create virtual env `virtualenv venv`
3. Activate virtual env => `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Optional: check if virtual env is activated by running `which python3`. It should give output something like `<workspaceFolder>/cli-client/venv/bin/python3`. if it is like `/usr/bin/python3` it is NOT activated
5. run `pip install -r  requirements.txt` for installing dependencies

## How to use the CLI Client

1. Use `w` to go up `s` to go down and watch in browser movements until i implement something better

> [!NOTE]
>
> `PONG` service must be running
> CLI Client must be run with `python3 main.py`
